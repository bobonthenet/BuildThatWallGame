## Running the game

  1. clone
  2. npm install
  3. grunt

## TODO:

  * Replace Trump head with Steve Bannon if player score is over 10,000.
  * Ads work but will only display every other game over. I think this is because the load method is only happening once, then the show method loads a new interstitial every other time.
